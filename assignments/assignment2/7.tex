Polymorphism is the ability to process objects differently depending on their
data type while still presenting the same interface.

Rust supports polymorphism, but in a dffernt way than you're used to
programming if you're used to Java. According to the Rust book:
``Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and trait
bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide. This is
sometimes called bounded parametric polymorphism.''
