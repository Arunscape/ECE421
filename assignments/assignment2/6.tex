\subsection{}
In question 4, most of the variables are on the stack, while the values in the
vectors are on the heap. Below is an attempt to demonstrate this. The iterators
are basically structs containing references to the actual values on the heap,
coupled with something that allows the iterator to keep track of its state, so
it knows where to go next.

\subsection{}
In question 5, almost everything is stored on the heap.
Structs that were on the stack in question 4 are now instead on the heap, and we
have pointers on the stack pointing to them. That's why in number 5, the
size of the value is always 8 bytes, since 8 byte are needed to point to a
location in memory on a 64-bit machine.
