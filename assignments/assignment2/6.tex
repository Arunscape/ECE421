Explain the results obtained in Question 4 and 5 while illustrating the contents of both the
stack and the heap in each case. [i.e., How does Rust model the iterators in each case?]

in number 5 the values are stored on the heap, and we are printing the size of
the pointer which points to the area on the heap. That's why in number 5, the
size of the value is always 8 bytes
